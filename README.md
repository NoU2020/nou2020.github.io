Hi! My name is 
## Jaclyn Ho.
Passionate about people, design, coding, and video games. I love learning new technologies and learning about people to better understand the world around me.


## About Me
I am a junior studying engineering with concentration in computing. I love learning new technologies and learning about people to better understand the world around me. I have worked on several coding, user experience and video game projects. Some languages I use include:
